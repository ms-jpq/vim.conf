# Synopsis

The challenges of updating a program with decades of legacy.

The main theme is as follows:

- Ossification of ecosystem around program

- Ossification of user habits

- Preventing future ossification

- Retaining extensibility & interoperability

- Bad traditions

### Prexisting Ecosystem

Instead of being seen as a burden, view ossification of code as unoffical API.

Like a compiler, transform thirdparty code through into static bundles.

Result: Zero runtime cost & Zero runtime error from thirdparty sources.

### User Habits

Users want a faster horse, but a faster horse is not worth the pain of breaking changes.

Need significant & obvious value proposition.

### Perpetual Greenfield

Zero implementation exposure. Implementation exposure leads to stagnation.

Putting users before developers.

### Interoperability

Communicate via Protocols (intentional or accidental), not implementations.

Total inversion of control, impossible for thirdparty to import own code.

### Break these traditions

UNIX (worse is better) design push burden from system designer onto users.

This is OK for software, but wetware is many times slower.

Design must recognize human are slow, forgetful, and error prone.
